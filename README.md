# CVE-2010-4502
 Integer overflow in KmxSbx.sys 6.2.0.22 in CA Internet Security Suite Plus 2010 allows local users to cause a denial of service (pool corruption) and execute arbitrary code via crafted arguments to the 0x88000080 IOCTL, which triggers a buffer overflow.

This repository holds the repository, and any correlating files, to CVE-2010-4502. Do not expect this to be finished immediately, but you can expect this to be done in less than three week's time (assuming Windows 7 allows me to map the NULL page ffs).

Post-poned until I actually learn integer overflows, because exploiting this vulnerability feels impossible.
